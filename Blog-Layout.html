<h2>What happens after death ??</h2>
<p>Most Muslims believe that when they die, they will stay in their graves until Yawm al-din (the Day of Judgement). On that day, they will be raised from their graves and brought before Allah and judged on how they lived their earthly lives. This belief is known as the resurrection of the body.</p>



<h2>What is the essence of marriage?</h2>
<p>In Islam;
    In conclusion, marriage holds great value and importance in Islam. It is viewed as a sacred bond between a man and a woman, and a means to attain peace, love, and tranquility through the mercy and compassion that exists between spouses.
    In other religions ;
    The Bible teaches, “Husbands, love your wives” (Ephesians 5:25) and “teach the young women … to love their husbands” (Titus 2:4). Love in marriage can be deeper and more selfless than in any other relationship. It is this type of love that Jesus expects of His followers, and it is the virtue that couples need the most.
